# Election Analysis
## Challenge 3: Python Module

### Overview of the Election Audit
#### Purpose
The purpose of this election analysisis is to determine the name of the candidate who won this election, as well as the county that had the most votes cast. To do this, we analyzed the following data:
1. Total votes cast overall

3. Votes cast per county

### Election Audit Results

    - Jefferson County cast 10.5% of the total votes (38,855)
    - Denver County cast 82.8% of the total votes (306,055)
    - Arapahoe County cast 6.7% of the total votes (24,801)
  - Denver County had the greatest number of votes cast of the three counties in this election
#### Candidates
  - There were three candidates in this election. Votes cast for each candidate are as follows:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the total votes (85,213)
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the total votes (272,892)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the total votes (11,606)
  - Diana DeGette received the greated number of votes and is the winning candidate in this election

### Election Audit Summary
As you can see, the script in this election audit was very efficient in how it provided the results. This script can be modified for use in other elections. Please read on to learn how this script may be used:
1. First, without any modification, this script can be suitable to produce results for any number of counties and candidates.
2. In the instance of a national election, this script can be modified to read out the votes by state rather than county. To do this, the script variables can change to read "state" rather than "county" as well as in the output, as so:
![county_to_state](Resouces/county_to_state.png)
3. This script may also be modified to figure out the number of votes cast per county (or other territory) for each candidate. *In all honesty, I cannot figure out how I would accomplish this, but all of the data is there.
